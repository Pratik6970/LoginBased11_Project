In this tutorial, we will create a login form where the front end is built using React.js, and the back end is powered by Spring Boot with REST, Spring Security, and MySQL.

In the front-end, we will create a registration form with fields for name, email, password, and about. When the "Register" button is clicked, the form data will be sent to the backend and stored in the MySQL database, completing the registration process. Upon successful registration, the user will be redirected to the login page.

In the login form, the user will enter their email and password. If the credentials match the ones stored in the database, the user will be redirected to the home page. On the home page, the user will be able to view their student information, including their name, email, and about details.

For added security, we will use the Bcrypt password encoder to encrypt the password before storing it in the database.
